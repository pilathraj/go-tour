## Switch
- A switch statement is a shorter way to write a sequence of if - else statements. It runs the first case whose value is equal to the condition expression.
- Go automatically break statement end of the case.
- Another important difference is that Go's switch cases need not be constants, and the values involved need not be integers.

```shell
cmd > go build main.go
cmd > main
